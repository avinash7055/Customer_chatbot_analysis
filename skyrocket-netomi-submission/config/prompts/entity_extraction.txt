ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT:
1. ORDER_ID - Order numbers, order identifiers (e.g., #123456, ORD-789)
2. TRACKING_NUMBER - Shipment tracking codes (e.g., 1Z999AA10123456784)
3. PRODUCT_NAME - Specific products mentioned by name
4. ACCOUNT_ID - Customer account numbers or IDs
5. EMAIL - Email addresses
6. PHONE - Phone numbers
7. AMOUNT - Monetary amounts (e.g., $29.99, 50 dollars)
8. DATE - Specific dates mentioned
9. LOCATION - Addresses, cities, states, countries

QUERY: "{query_text}"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON array):
[
  {
    "type": "<entity_type>",
    "value": "<extracted_value>",
    "confidence": "high | medium | low"
  },
  ...
]

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract ALL entities you can identify with reasonable confidence
- If no entities are found, return empty array []
- Use "high" confidence for exact matches (emails, numbers)
- Use "medium" confidence for likely matches (product names from context)
- Use "low" confidence for ambiguous extractions
- Be precise - extract the EXACT value, not surrounding context

EXAMPLES:

Query: "I want to track my order #12345 shipped to New York"
Output:
[
  {"type": "ORDER_ID", "value": "#12345", "confidence": "high"},
  {"type": "LOCATION", "value": "New York", "confidence": "high"}
]

Query: "The iPhone 14 Pro I ordered for $999 hasn't arrived"
Output:
[
  {"type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "value": "iPhone 14 Pro", "confidence": "high"},
  {"type": "AMOUNT", "value": "$999", "confidence": "high"}
]

Query: "My tracking number is 1Z999AA10123456784"
Output:
[
  {"type": "TRACKING_NUMBER", "value": "1Z999AA10123456784", "confidence": "high"}
